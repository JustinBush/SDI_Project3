<p>My story and is based on going out with my cousin, her husband and my boyfriend. We usually go out
to the movies and to a restaurant. We are all around the same age group so we have lots of fun when 
we get together. I chose this as my story, because it reminds me of the times we have gone out and it 
brings me joy and a lot of laughter.</p>

<p>The continuation of this story picks up on the following weekend. We all decided to hang out
again, but this time we went on on Saturday so that we can go out to dinner as well.</p>
